# Dungeon Core

Build, protect, and conquer in Dungeon Core!
The once peaceful lands are now under siege by relentless adventurers, all after your precious crystal. The only way to stop them? Your factory!
Harness the power of powerful factory systems to mine valuable minerals, craft powerful traps, and fortify your defenses. Design cutting-edge traps and strategic layouts to halt invaders in their tracks before they reach your crystal.
Will your factory be the last line of defense, or will the adventurers steal your prize? The fate of your crystal is in your hands!
Build your factory, craft your traps, and protect your treasure from the oncoming invasion.


## Project Goals

* Bring the adventurers to life with differing pathfinding algorithms and skill sets.
* Make a game in the factory genere that I enjoy that happens to be a niche that not many games are made in.
